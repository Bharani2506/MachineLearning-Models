This repository is dedicated to exploring and benchmarking several machine learning models. Each model is demonstrated through detailed Jupyter notebooks that include theoretical backgrounds, code implementation, and visual performance analysis. This project is ideal for learners, educators, and practitioners looking to understand different machine learning dynamics on a common dataset.
